## Introduction

For the past few months, I have been completing the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** offered on Coursera. I have been learning about the six stages of the data analysis process (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, & act), and how to use technical tools (SQL, Tableau, R) in each stage to ultimately gather insights from large amounts of data. To finish the course, Google recommends that each student creates their own Capstone Project to highlight the technical skills they learned during the course and to showcase their understanding of each step of the data analysis process. As such, I have completed my Capstone Project on the Cyclistic Case Study.


## Project Background

In this case study, I am assuming the position of ‘Data Analyst’ at Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago. Cyclistic offers over 6000 bikes at 800+ docking stations spread around Chicago. At the moment they offer classic bikes and electric bikes for use and they have two customer segments: **Casuals and Members**. Casuals are classified as customers who either buy a single-trip pass or a day pass, whereas Members are classified as customers that buy annual memberships.
